# proglangfinal
final proj for 2018 spring

programming languages course final project involved students designing & implementing something in a programming language
of their choice (one they had no prior experience in/significant exposure to)

over the course of a month or so, looked into basic lua syntax, etc. and basically just implemented a very watered down
version of pokemon. main focus was the battle simulation but with more time i think i had wanted to integrate more 
role-playing elements too & how to implement a gui w/ lua

i like lua though its fun
